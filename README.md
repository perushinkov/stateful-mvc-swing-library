# stateful-mvc-swing-library
<p>A swing library I use in some of my work projects.</p>

<p>Contains classes that facilitate the easy creation of state-based Swing applications.</p>

<p>I've tried to Javadoc properly all the important classes. Here are the ones you should take a look at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/perushinkov/stateful-mvc-swing-library/blob/master/src/main/java/perushinkov/swinglib/view/MVCView.java">MVCView</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/perushinkov/stateful-mvc-swing-library/blob/master/src/main/java/perushinkov/swinglib/utils/CSS.java">CSS</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/perushinkov/stateful-mvc-swing-library/blob/master/src/main/java/perushinkov/swinglib/utils/SwingFactory.java">SwingFactory</a>
  </li>
  plus this nice component:
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/perushinkov/stateful-mvc-swing-library/blob/master/src/main/java/perushinkov/swinglib/model/PairEditorTableModel.java">PairEditorTableModel</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a preview of what an example view implementation looks like:<p>

NOTE:
I've created a sizeable Swing application using this library, which I won't be able
to share, since it's part of a work project.

I am currently working on a smaller-scale Swing application which will use this library 
and serve as an example (<a href="https://github.com/perushinkov/vocab-tracker">link</a>). I also  intend to add a quite small "Hello world" application
to demonstrate the framework.
